Before filming or editing any project, the most important considerations will always materialize during the planning phase. Vek Labs stands by a focused pre-production process that ensures all crucial conversations and pain points have been addressed before hitting 'record'. We manage your content creation by addressing the following areas: 

## The Planning Phase

### Project Vision:

What is the scope and purpose of your production project? What are the milestones that your team wants to hit during the lifecycle of your content? At a high-level, our team intuits your vision and looks for any pain points that need to be addressed. Our team desires to be a humble and collaborative partner for your business. Once your vision has been realized, we move into more specific areas of planning your production. 

### Mood and Story: 

Creative projects can be very subjective but they do not have to be unclear. During the pre-production process we meet with your team to brainstorm. Establishing a clear vision around the mood of your production. What is the tone? Considerations we look at are: Emotive elements important for your brand, colour pallets, lighting aesthetics and thematic refinement. Coherent story flow allows us to plan the necessary interview questions and acted scenes that will make your project successful. 

### Resource Allocation: 

Identifying resources needed to turn your vision into reality is so important. Together we secure the right resources for your production: 

1. **Location Selection:** Securing Studio Space, Outdoor Locations, Drone and film permitting as required. 
2. **Talent Selection:** Vek Labs works with close partners to secure the right talent for your production. 
3. **Props and Equipment:** Selection of vehicles, staging and equipment as needed. 

### The Shotlist: 

Having defined all resources and elements for your production, our photography team submits a shotlist to communicate what will be captured during the filming and capture process.  

## Ready to Film: 

We believe in the creation of an excellent plan. Having rallied together towards measurable benchmarks for your projects success we then go to work and film to make your videos come to life.
