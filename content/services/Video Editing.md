## Video Editing 

Your project really comes together in the editing booth! From sequencing of footage, to soundscapes, colour treatment, SFX and Motion Graphics. Looking for an editing team to make your content goals happen? Vek Labs is in your corner! 

## Post-Production House 

### Story-Based Editing:

Consulting your overall vision, we focus on the best selections that were captured during the filming process. Interview selects, B-Roll sequences and acted scenes are all webbed together to get a rough draft ready for review. 

### Voiceover Work:

Either in-house or sourcing other vocal talent for your commercial, we focus on capturing the correct tone and pronunciation for your video project. It is amazing what can happen when the right voice speaks for your brand! 

### Sound and Music: 

Our team and partners can provide either commercial-use music and soundscapes or custom scores from award-winning musicians. Music and sound is perhaps the biggest attribute to emotional impact within any video. Our team is not satisfied until we really 'feel' the production. 

### Colour Grading: 

Using either Adobe or Davinci Resolve software; our team is skilled in colour grading for social media or other distribution avenues. Cool tones, or warm sunshine visuals; colouring frames is so important. 

### Motion Graphics:

Overlay elements for commercials, ads or longer video productions provides more visual communication for your audience. Logo elements, icons, transitions and other effects can take your production to another level. 

### Typography:

Our editorial team comes from a graphic design background. Selection of the perfect typefaces for your brand or video campaign is crucial. In a subtle way it provides clarity to your brand. An important part when polishing a production. 

## VEK Guarantee: 

When specified, we deliver a RAW video render of all usable content to you within 24 hours of filming at no additional cost.
