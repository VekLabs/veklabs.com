## Drone Video Company Calgary 

Take your next project to the clouds! At Vek Labs we love to fly and capture excellent B-Roll for productions. We can fly and capture content in a wide range of scenarios. 

There are a lot of complexities to consider when flying a drone. New regulations, flight plans, equipment required and possible fines for failure to comply can seem daunting. Vek Labs has you covered! We partner with you and take care of all specifications. The result? You can focus on getting the shots you want! 

### Planning Drone Flights

**1. Shot Selection:** Discerning the desired visuals that need to be captured. 

**2. Location Selection:** Using flight selection tools we make sure we can fly and film to meet your specifications. 

**3. NavCANADA Flight Plans & Permits:** When required, we do all submission paperwork on your behalf to make sure we have a safe and approved flight plan for your production. 

**4. Pilot and Spotter:** We work as a team, making sure drones are operated safely and effectively.
