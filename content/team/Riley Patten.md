From filming his friends skateboarding as a kid, Riley soon realized his passion for cameras was going to last a lifetime. Riley studied film and video production at the Southern Alberta Institute of Technology. Before joining Vek Labs, Riley worked in the post-production department for Fargo Season 3. From there he moved to Vancouver, British Columbia to join the west coast film scene as an on-set dailies operator and digital imaging technician. Rileyâ€™s desire to capture meaningful moments is demonstrated by the sheer amount of time he spends working with clients to design every moment captured.
