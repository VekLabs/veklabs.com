Andrew here. I’m thrilled to announce that Vek Labs has been awarded the opportunity to produce a multi-episode documentary series exploring wildfires and forestry. This project will take us deep into the heart of communities that have been tested by the intensity and unpredictability of wildfires, highlighting their remarkable courage and resilience.

Our team has been hard at work throughout 2024 and we will continue into 2025 capturing firsthand accounts from community members, firefighters, and forestry experts. Through this series, we aim to shed light on the environmental, social, and economic impacts of wildfires—while also celebrating the human spirit that unites neighbors, volunteers, and professionals during times of crisis.

We look forward to sharing more details in 2025 as we bring these powerful stories to the screen. Keep an eye on our blog and social media channels for updates on filming progress, sneak peeks, and behind-the-scenes stories. Thank you for your continued support, and please join us in celebrating this next exciting chapter at Vek Labs!
