We had the opportunity to capture JJ Shiplett’s electrifying performance at Cult’s The Gathering conference in Banff, where he performed his song “Freeman.” Surrounded by the majestic backdrop of the Rockies, we aimed to reflect the energy of the live show through carefully chosen angles and dynamic editing. Every note and lyric was brought to life on screen, showcasing JJ’s raw talent and the unique atmosphere of the event.

Our final edit, set to “Freeman,” weaves together close-ups of the singer’s impassioned delivery with wider shots of the venue, conveying both the intimacy and scale of the performance. This live video stands as a testament to the spirit of The Gathering—a celebration of creativity and connection—as well as JJ Shiplett’s undeniable stage presence. We’re thrilled to have been part of capturing such an unforgettable musical moment in Banff.
