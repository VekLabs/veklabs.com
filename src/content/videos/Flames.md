We had the exciting opportunity to partner with actor Jarod Joseph and the Calgary Flames to launch a co-branded Flames apparel line. This project aimed to highlight the connection between a dedicated fan community and the team’s iconic spirit. 

The final piece reached a wide audience, gaining traction on social media and earning airtime on Sportsnet during Calgary Flames games. Through dynamic visuals and a cohesive narrative, we not only spotlighted the collaboration but also celebrated the strong sense of community that underpins the Flames’ culture. This collaboration underscored our commitment to creating impactful storytelling—delivering content that resonates far beyond the initial launch.
