We had the thrilling opportunity to capture Drum N DJ at the Cowboy’s Festival during the Calgary Stampede—an epic setting for an unforgettable performance. The dynamic duo of drummer Brett Jones and DJ KAV put on a show that kept the energy levels soaring from start to finish. We focused on highlighting the synchronized beats, the high-octane crowd, and the signature Stampede spirit that made this event so memorable.

Our final montage weaves together the festival’s vibrant atmosphere with close-up shots of the performers, underscoring the chemistry and excitement that Drum N DJ bring to every stage. From rapid-fire snare hits to pulse-pounding drops, every moment is a testament to the power of live music in uniting a crowd. The result is an adrenaline-fueled glimpse into one of the Stampede’s most electrifying acts—and a testament to the energy that keeps audiences coming back for more.
