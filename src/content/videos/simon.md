We had the privilege of showcasing Simon Doty’s journey from his rugged Alberta roots and college basketball days to his rise as a sought-after electronic music producer and DJ. Filming among the dramatic landscapes of western Canada, we emphasized the unlikely path that took Simon from shooting hoops to mastering cutting-edge music gear. His self-taught approach and innate understanding of composition and engineering proved to be the secret ingredients that caught the attention of both new fans and industry icons worldwide.

In collaboration with RECESS and Rhetorical Music, our video delved into Simon’s personal backstory, spotlighting how drive and passion can bridge the gap between seemingly disparate worlds. Through interviews, performance footage, and an inside look at his creative process, we captured the essence of his evolution as a “whiz kid” sound selector—one whose distinctive style continues to resonate with audiences across the globe.
