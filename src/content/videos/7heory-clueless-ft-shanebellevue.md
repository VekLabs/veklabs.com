Vek Labs had the incredible opportunity to produce the music video for “Clueless” by 7HEORY, a visually striking and emotionally charged piece that brings the song’s themes to life. Shot in an abandoned house just one week before its demolition, the setting provided a haunting yet cinematic backdrop, perfectly complementing the song’s raw energy and introspective lyrics. The aged walls, peeling paint, and echoes of the past added an authentic, almost eerie texture to the storytelling, capturing a sense of nostalgia and fleeting time that resonated deeply with the music.

Every frame of “Clueless” was crafted to reflect the depth and emotion of 7HEORY’s artistry, blending atmospheric lighting, dynamic cinematography, and powerful performances. The decaying structure became a character in itself, symbolizing change, loss, and the impermanence of moments we often take for granted. This collaboration allowed us to push creative boundaries, making use of the unique environment to enhance the song’s impact. The result is a music video that not only showcases 7HEORY’s talent but also stands as a fleeting piece of history, immortalizing a space that no longer exists.
