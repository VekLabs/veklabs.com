We are honored to partner with **Amanda Achtman** in her powerful storytelling campaign, *Dying to Meet You*—a project that brings forward real, intimate stories about death and dying to break the silence and undo the taboo surrounding these deeply human experiences. Through thoughtful conversations and compelling narratives, Amanda invites us to rethink how we approach the end of life—not as something to fear or avoid, but as a moment of profound connection, dignity, and meaning.

This particular story is one of our favorites, capturing the raw beauty of presence, love, and courage in the face of mortality. By amplifying voices that share their encounters with loss, grief, and farewell, *Dying to Meet You* fosters a space where death is not hidden away but embraced as part of life. Through our collaboration, we hope to continue bringing these stories to light, encouraging deeper, more honest conversations about the realities of dying—and the ways in which it can teach us to live.
