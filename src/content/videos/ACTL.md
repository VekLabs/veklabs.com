Our team had the opportunity to produce a video showcasing the Alberta Carbon Trunk Line (ACTL), one of the world’s most groundbreaking carbon capture, utilization, and storage (CCUS) projects. Through a combination of sweeping aerial footage, cinematography and voiceover narration, we highlighted how the ACTL’s 240-kilometre pipeline transports captured carbon dioxide from Alberta’s Industrial Heartland to mature oil fields, where it is used for enhanced oil recovery and subsequently stored.

In producing this project, we focused on capturing both the technical intricacy and the broader impact of the ACTL. Through careful editing and storytelling, we aimed to engage viewers with the significance of carbon capture efforts, demonstrating how the ACTL stands at the forefront of sustainable innovation in Alberta and beyond.
