We had the privilege of creating a rebrand video for CDN Controls, aimed at clarifying and spotlighting what the team excels at—delivering cutting-edge automation, electrical, and instrumentation solutions with a steadfast commitment to reliability, innovation, and safety. By weaving together interviews, behind-the-scenes footage, and real-life applications of their expertise, we showcased how CDN’s culture and mission come alive in every project. This new brand identity underscores their dedication to providing unparalleled service across Western Canada’s energy sector.

Following the launch of the rebrand, we extend our heartfelt congratulations to CDN Controls on their acquisition by the Hoffman Group—a clear testament to the strength and value of their organization. This video stands as both a celebration of CDN Controls’ past achievements, present market impact and a preview of the promising future ahead, capturing a team that continues to push boundaries while staying true to their core values.
