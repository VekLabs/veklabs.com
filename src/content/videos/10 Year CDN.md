The “10 Years of CDN” video was our very first collaboration with [CDN ](https://cdncontrols.ca/en-ca/)and remains a milestone project in our portfolio. We had the privilege of spotlighting the founders’ genuine passion and determination that fueled the company from its early days to its current success. Through interviews, archival photos, and evocative footage of the team in action, this video captured the spirit that drives CDN’s culture of innovation and service.

Since completing that project, we’ve been honored to become CDN’s official brand story partners. It’s been a rewarding journey working side by side, witnessing their growth, and helping shape their visual storytelling approach. This initial video, reflecting the heart of CDN’s story, laid the foundation for an ongoing creative relationship—one that continues to celebrate the company’s roots, values, and impact on those they serve.
