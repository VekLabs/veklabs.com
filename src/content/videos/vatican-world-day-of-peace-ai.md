Vek Labs had the honor of producing a compelling video on artificial intelligence for the World Day of Peace, commissioned by the Dicastery for Promoting Integral Human Development in the Vatican. This thought-provoking piece explores the ethical implications, opportunities, and challenges that AI presents in shaping the future of humanity. Through powerful storytelling and striking visuals, the video reflects on how technology, when guided by human dignity and moral responsibility, can serve the common good rather than undermine it.

By weaving together expert insights, theological reflections, and a hopeful vision for the future, the video emphasizes the Vatican’s call for an AI that is human-centered, ethical, and aligned with principles of justice and peace. It serves as both a reflection and an invitation—encouraging global leaders, developers, and society at large to engage in thoughtful dialogue on how artificial intelligence can contribute to a more just and compassionate world.
