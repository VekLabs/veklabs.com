We recently had the privilege of producing a television ad for Gemstone Lights, set to air during NHL hockey games across Western Canada. Our goal was to showcase how Gemstone Lights’ smart lighting solutions help celebrate the spirit of hockey in style, embracing the excitement that surrounds Canada’s favorite sport. From concept to final cut, we strived to capture the unifying spirit of the game and highlight how these cutting-edge, residential lighting systems can complement any hockey fan’s home.



By pairing Gemstone Lights with the thrill of NHL hockey, we aimed to connect fans’ passion for the sport with the brand’s dedication to innovation and energy-efficient design. We believe this ad demonstrates how homeowners can elevate their curb appeal, cheer on their favorite teams, and transform their surroundings with vibrant, customizable lighting. Ultimately, it was an honor to bring Gemstone Lights’ vision to life and to share in Canada’s beloved hockey tradition.
