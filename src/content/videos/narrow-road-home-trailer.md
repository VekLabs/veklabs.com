Narrow Road Home is a unique faith-centered healing program for women struggling with addiction, domestic violence, mental health issues, emotional disturbances, life crisis or abuse. NRH is for women who have finally come to the end and are willing to try a new way of life. Women who are tired of their current destructive coping mechanisms and adaptations that are no longer working.
