Our US-based company is moving to adopt our in-person training content to the online and virtual environment. We needed to find a video production vendor that was professional and knowledgable in this area and also had the personality that fit well with our corporate culture. Our search led us to VekLabs in Calgary, Alberta.

Andrew and Riley had online meetings with us to verify the scope of the project and precisely the goals we wanted to achieve. VekLabs arranged for the filming location and all the required infrstructure to be successful. We filmed onsite for two very long days to capture all the content and the atmosphere was consistently positive and professional. The video files that were captured were coded and sent to our video editing lab within 24 hours post-production. We were blown away by the customer service and the quality of work.

As our company continues to move forward with other video projects, we are looking forward to working with the amazing team from VekLabs again!
